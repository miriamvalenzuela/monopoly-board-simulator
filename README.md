# CS210 Programming Assignment
## Monopoly Board Simulator (Spring 2026)

### Overview
In this assignment, you will implement a Monopoly-style game board using a **circular linked list**. Unlike previous offerings, the circular structure is not just for storage, it is the engine for traversal and gameplay. Your program will simulate a player moving around a fixed-size Monopoly board, passing GO, and interacting with board spaces through pointer-based movement.

### This assignment emphasizes
- Correct implementation of a circular linked list.
- Careful pointer management under constraints.
- Traversal-based logic instead of index-based shortcuts.
- Professional development practices using GitHub.

---

## Board Constraints
- The Monopoly board has a maximum of **40 spaces**.
- Your linked list must **never exceed 40 nodes**.
- Once the board reaches capacity, additional insertions must be rejected cleanly **without corrupting the list**.

---

## Board Construction Policy (Read This Carefully)
Spaces are added during a **board construction phase**, before gameplay begins.

How you build the board is intentionally **left to you**. You may:
- Define each space manually in code.
- Load spaces from a file.
- Generate spaces programmatically (including random generation).

There is **no single required way** to construct the board. The requirement is that your implementation:
- Supports adding spaces using the provided insertion functions.
- Correctly enforces the 40-space limit.
- Preserves circular integrity regardless of construction strategy.

---

## How to Build and Run
### Build
From the project directory:
- `g++ -std=c++17 monopoly_board.cpp -o monopoly_board`

### Run
- `./monopoly_board`

---

## Core Requirements (40 points)
### Core A: Add a Space with Capacity Enforcement (10 points)
**Function:** `addSpace(...)`  
**Description:** Adds a new node to the tail, maintains circular structure, enforces max size 40, returns success/failure beyond capacity.

### Core B: Add Multiple Spaces at Once (10 points)
**Function:** `addMany(...)`  
**Description:** Adds spaces sequentially, stops exactly at capacity, returns how many were added, and does not corrupt pointers.

### Core C: Traversal-Based Player Movement (10 points)
**Function:** `movePlayer(int n)`  
**Description:** Moves a player cursor forward by `n` steps node-by-node, wraps around, and tracks how many times the player passes GO.

### Core D: Controlled Board Display (10 points)
**Function:** `printFromPlayer(int count)`  
**Description:** Prints a fixed number of spaces starting from the player (or a starting point if you design it that way) with a safe stop condition (no infinite loops).

---

## Playable Simulation Requirement
Your `main.cpp` must demonstrate a simple playable traversal loop:
- Build the board (up to 40 spaces).
- Place a player at the starting space.
- Simulate multiple turns:
    - Roll a dice (2–12).
    - Move the player.
    - Print the space landed on.
    - Track how many times the player passes GO.

This is **not** a full Monopoly game. The goal is to prove traversal correctness.

---

## Advanced Requirements (20 points total)
Choose **one** of the following paths.

### Option A: Two Level 1 Features (10 points each)
1) `removeByName(string name)`
- Deletes the first matching space.
- Must correctly handle:
    - deleting the head node,
    - deleting the only-node list,
    - deleting the tail node.

2) `findByColor(string color)`
- Returns a `vector<string>` of matching space names or prints matching spaces.
- Must traverse the ring **exactly once** using a correct stop condition.

### Option B: One Level 2 Feature (20 points)
**Mirror the Board (Circular List Reversal)**  
Implement a function that reverses the traversal direction of the circular linked list.

Required behavior:
- Reverses the `next` links of all nodes.
- Preserves circular structure (the list must still loop correctly).
- Correctly handles:
    - empty board,
    - single-node board.
- The player cursor must remain on the **same logical space** after reversal.

---

## Edge Case Handling (20 points)
Your program must correctly handle the following:
- Operations on an empty board.
- A single-node circular list.
- Deleting the head node.
- Deleting the tail node.
- Adding multiple spaces up to exactly 40 without corruption.

---

## GitHub & Process Requirements (20 points)
### Repository
- Each student must use their **own public GitHub repository**.
- The Canvas submission must be a link to the public repo.

### Commit History
- Minimum **10 commits**.
- Commits must be spread over **at least 14 days**.
- Commits made in one sitting will not receive full credit.

### Developer Log
- Include a `DEVLOG.md` file.
- Minimum **6 entries**.

### README
Your `README.md` must include:
- Build and run instructions.
- Description of data structures used.
- A complete list of functions with short explanations.
- Explanation of traversal and movement logic.
- Explicit mention of the **40-space board limit**.

---

## Submission
- Submit the GitHub repository link on Canvas.
- No zip files.
- Late submissions follow standard course policy.

## Notes
This assignment is about thinking in pointers, not arrays. If your logic depends on indexing shortcuts, you are solving the wrong problem. Treat the board like a ring, because that is exactly what it is.
